+```
+Title: Crypto Reminder Board
+
+Description:
+Create a simple app where users can write, save, and manage personal crypto-related reminders. The app must work fully offline and should not use the internet or external APIs. All reminders are entered manually by the user.
+
+Functionality:
+ • Display an input field labeled “New Reminder” where the user can type any reminder text.
+ • Include a button labeled “Add Reminder” that adds the new reminder to a visible list on the page.
+ • Below the input, show a section titled “Your Reminders” displaying all saved reminders in a simple list.
+ • Each reminder in the list should have a small “Delete” button next to it, allowing the user to remove it individually.
+ • Add a “Clear All” button that deletes all reminders at once.
+ • If the user tries to add an empty reminder, display a message:
+“Please enter a reminder before adding.”
+
+UI Requirements:
+ • Use only basic UI elements such as text fields, buttons, and lists.
+ • Layout should be clean, minimal, and easy to use.
+ • All interactions must update the reminder list instantly and locally.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
